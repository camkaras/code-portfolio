                    My name is Cameron Karasiuk and I am an 18 year old from
                    small town Ontario learning how to code. So far Its been
                    very challenging but Im looking forward to improving. I 
                    am currently working on learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                    I hope to be able to  one day become a fullstack developer. 
                    Trying to balance a fulltime job, and coding has been a very 
                    difficult thing for me and the more i throw myself into this 
                    crazy new world of code, the more addicted I become to it. 
                    Stayed tuned for new projects and updates. Thanks For The Support - Cam
